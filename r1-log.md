# 💻 100 Days of Code – Round 1: [Hoybyte]

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode journey — a commitment to sharpening my coding skills and documenting my growth along the way.  

**Challenge Start Date**: **Friday, July 4, 2025**

This log will serve as a daily record of what I learn, build, and reflect on as I dive deeper into web development and related technologies. Let’s get started!

### 📅 Round 1 Day 0 – Rebooting My Dev Environment

- **System Setup**:  
  Installed a fresh copy of Windows 11 on a new laptop.

- **Development Environment**:  
  Configured Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to enable a Linux-based dev workflow.

- **Editor Customization**:  
  Installed and customized Visual Studio Code to support Vim keybindings in an effort to become more efficient with modal editing.

- **Version Control Workflow**:  
  Reacquainted myself with GitLens for Visual Studio Code to sync a local repository with GitHub.

- **Reflection**:  
  It’s been a while since I worked in a development capacity; my recent experience has been more focused on systems administration. This marks a fresh start as I dive back into the developer mindset.

### 📅 Round 1 · Day 1 — Building the Website Layout

- **🛠️ Created Basic Site Structure**  
  I kicked off my portfolio project by setting up a foundational layout. The initial version includes:  
  - A navigation bar  
  - A paragraph section  
  - A basic form element  

- **🧩 Added Image & Navigation Templates**  
  I integrated an image for the logo and implemented navigation links across the top of the page. I used GitHub Copilot to scaffold additional HTML templates to structure the overall layout.

- **🎨 Began CSS Styling**  
  I started styling the layout with CSS, aiming to get the navigation bar aligned horizontally across the top. It's not working as expected yet, so I'll continue troubleshooting and refining the styles.

- **📖 Next Steps**  
  I'll keep reviewing the HTML and CSS documentation to ensure I'm using the right syntax and best practices to resolve the layout issues.

### Round 1 - Day 2 🌐🧠  
**Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Focus:** Migrating workflow to Ubuntu & refining portfolio setup  

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Installed Ubuntu 24 on personal laptop  
- Created user account and performed system updates  
- Installed essential dev tools: Git, VS Code, GitHub Copilot  
- Configured personal apps (e.g., music player for focused workflow)  
- Used `gh repo clone` to pull challenge and portfolio repositories  
- Discovered naming error in portfolio repository and corrected by creating a new one  

## 🧠 Lessons Learned:
- Practical use of `gh repo clone` for efficient repo management  
- Attention to naming conventions matters for future professionalism  
- Linux setup can be fast and rewarding when properly planned  

## ⚠️ Notes:
- Missed a few days due to illness (Covid). Rested and resumed with momentum  

## 💬 Reflection:
Migrating to Ubuntu was a rewarding shift—tools now feel faster and the environment more customizable. Fixing the portfolio repo name was a reminder of how small details make a big impact, especially when building a professional presence. Despite the health setback, it feels good to be back in motion.
