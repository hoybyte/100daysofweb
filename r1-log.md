Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode journey â€” a commitment to sharpening my coding skills and documenting my growth along the way.

This log will serve as a daily record of what I learn, build, and reflect on as I dive deeper into web development and related technologies. Letâ€™s get started!

### ðŸ“… Round 1 Day 0 â€“ Rebooting My Dev Environment

- **System Setup**:  
  Installed a fresh copy of Windows 11 on a new laptop.

- **Development Environment**:  
  Configured Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to enable a Linux-based dev workflow.

- **Editor Customization**:  
  Installed and customized Visual Studio Code to support Vim keybindings in an effort to become more efficient with modal editing.

  Reacquainted myself with GitLens for Visual Studio Code to sync a local repository with GitHub.

  Itâ€™s been a while since I worked in a development capacity; my recent experience has been more focused on systems administration. This marks a fresh start as I dive back into the developer mindset.
